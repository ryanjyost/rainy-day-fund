		   <h1>What is a Rainy Day Fund?</h1>

		   <h3>
				A rainy day fund, a.k.a. an <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergency_fund.asp" target="_blank">
				emergency fund</a>, is a savings account established for one purpose - to weather a financial disaster, e.g. the
				loss of your job, unexpected medical expenses, a much-needed car repair, etc.
		   </h3>

		   <h3>
				If you are <a href="https://www.creditdonkey.com/average-american-savings-statistics.html" target="_blank" >
				like many Americans</a>, you are not financially prepared for tough times. Without the cushion of an emergency
				fund, you increase the likelihood of abusing credit cards, missing important payments, prematurely tapping
				retirement accounts and eventual bankruptcy.
		   </h3>

		   <h3>
				Financial planners often recommend having an emergency fund that can cover 3-6 months of expenses. This can seem
				like quite a lot, a near impossible goal - but knowing the basics of an emergency and what it takes
				to fund one is a solid first step toward better personal finance and peace of mind.

				This app has 3 steps.<br/><br/>
				1. Assumptions - Just basic info to get things started.<br/><br/>
				2. Expenses - List out your monthly expenses to determine the proper size of your emergency fund and get a
				   clear picture of your financial obligations.  <br/><br/>
				3. Savings Plan - See how long it would take to fund your emergency fund, and experiment with how much you want to save each month to reach your goal.
